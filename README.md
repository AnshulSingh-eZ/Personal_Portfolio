# React + Tailwind + Vite

This is my Personal Protfolio to showcase my skills and achievements build using React.js.

# Personal_Portfolio
Build using Reactjs | Static website

Steps to run : 

1) Clone this repo in your PC (https://github.com/AnshulSingh-eZ/Personal_Portfolio.git)
2) You can change the data as the website is divided in several different components like home, about, projects ... sections. Data is appended in sections itself.
3) After saving the changes, Open terminal and write the command : 
npm run dev

4) Go to localhost as specified and there you will be able to view the website.

Thanks!!
